### Citibike Summary
In general we learned that there really isn't much of a gender discrepancy around days and time day people like to ride CitiBikes. The majority of the riders are male and the most common trip is 20 minutes or less. To further investigate we could which areas are the most common starting places of bikes rides. We could also see if those popular starting spots were consistent with regard to when people are riding from those spots. This would help ensure we had enough bikes in the right locations at the right times.
